                        <p>The Finger-Head game is a fun activity to do with your friends. However, if you’re not around 
                            your buddies, you can now play it in this browser version of the game. Harness your quickdraw prowess 
                            (or quickclick as the case may be) and challenge your electronic opponent. You or the computer selects 
                            a direction to point (as the “finger”) using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right), while the opponent 
                            simultaneously selects a direction to look (as the “head”) by using the arrow keys. If the player “looks” or 
                            swivels their head in the same direction as the opponent “points” to, they lose. 
                            The players switch between being the “finger” and the “head” each turn. Can you outwit your opponent?
